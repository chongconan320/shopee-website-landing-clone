      <Section title={"SHOP FOR VARIETY WITH SHOPEE"}>
        Everyone loves online shopping for the convenience and the low prices
        are a bonus! Shopee Malaysia strives to help you get a bang for your
        buck with multiple sales and promotions happening at any one time. Make
        sure your wallet is ready for our big sales campaigns, such as 7.7
        Orange Madness, 9.9 Super Shopping Day, 10.10 Brands Festival, 11.11 Big
        Sale, and 12.12 Birthday Sale. We also have massive sales and offer
        great savings to you during major festivals like Chinese New Year and
        Raya! At the same time, check in often because we also have smaller sale
        periods which are category-specific, such as our Baby Fair and Black
        Friday sales. <br /> <br />
        Let’s not forget about the frequently occurring Super Brand Day! On
        these days, specific brands offer amazing deals for their top-selling
        items, so be sure to keep an eye out to see if your favourite brand is
        featuring. Of course, there are always different kinds of smaller
        promotions happening every day, so you really will benefit if you
        constantly check your Shopee app or the website to ensure you are not
        missing any mind-blowing offers! Want even more savings? Then apply for
        the Maybank Shopee Credit Card so you can earn Shopee coins when
        spending on Shopee purchases, dining, entertainment, and contactless
        transactions. More Shopee coins mean more discounts during your shopping
        sprees on our platform!
